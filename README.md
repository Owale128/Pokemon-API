# Pokemon-API! ðŸ˜ƒ

This project is a web application to search for PokÃ©mon cards from the PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game database. Users can search for Pokemon cards via a form, and display results with images and animations. The application uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript/TypeScript. An asynchronous request is made to the PokÃ©mon TCG API using Axios, and the search results display in a stylized grid.
